Create Users with Unique IDs, Names, and Ages:

Define a Mongoose schema for users in your Node.js application.
Implement functionality in your application to create users and ensure their uniqueness based on IDs.
Users should have attributes like ID, name, and age.
Modify Tasks to Allow Assignment:

Update your Mongoose schema for tasks to include a field for assigned users.
Modify your task creation process to allow for task assignment to users.
Create a JS File to Upload Local Tasks and Users to MongoDB:

Implement a script that reads data (tasks and users) from local files.
Use Mongoose to insert this data into your MongoDB database.
Create and Use 2 Mongoose Schemas:

You'll already have schemas for users and tasks. Ensure they are correctly defined and used throughout your application.
Create a New Controller JS Using the Cloud Database:

Create a controller that handles operations like creating users, creating tasks, updating users, updating tasks, getting all users, getting all tasks, getting one user, getting one task, deleting users, and deleting tasks.
Use Mongoose to interact with your MongoDB database for these operations.
Handle User Deletion with Assigned Tasks:

When deleting users, check if they have assigned tasks.
If they do, reassign those tasks to be unassigned.
Create an Interface for the Updated Task Manager:

Create at least three HTML files (e.g., one for user management, one for task management, and one for the main interface).
Implement navigation within the interface using HTML/CSS and potentially JavaScript for routing.
Enhance Task Display:

Modify your HTML and CSS to ensure that each task displays a name, description, ID, and a checkbox for completion.
Implement the strike-through and text-darken effect for completed tasks using JavaScript and CSS.
Testing and Debugging:

Thoroughly test your application to ensure that it meets the requirements and works as expected.
Debug any issues that arise during testing.
Deployment (if applicable):

If you're deploying this web application to a live server, make sure to configure your server environment and deploy your application.
